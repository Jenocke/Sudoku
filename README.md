# Sudoku
This app is a sudoku game with an in-built sudoku generator

The generator is based on a generator I made myself almost one year ago, that I'll remake with better and cleaner code.

I'll change the console.logs and alert interactions with the user with proper text-areas and react scripts.

##Objective
The player is showed a sudoku puzzle. He can fill the blank spaces. After he finishes, the app check his solution and tell him the result.
The sudoku presented to the player is generated randomly for every game.

##Planning
1. Generating a sudoku grid
2. Deleting elements in the grid (To be added later : difficulty system that will influence the number of elements deleted)
3. Displaying the grid to the player
4. Handling the filling of the grid. The part that were initially displayed cannot be changed.
5. when submitted, check the filled grid.
